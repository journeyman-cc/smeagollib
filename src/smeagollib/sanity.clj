;; The general idea behind the 'check-' functions in this file is that, if the
;; check passes, they return true; if it fails, they return a map of problems found.
;; the map comprises keys bound to 'explanation' lists of keywords and strings. If
;; internationalisation is available, the keywords will then be translated into
;; localised strings for presentation to the user; but if it isn't available,
;; the keywords need to be human readable. Sanity checking ought to work even
;; when the installation is quite badly broken.
