# smeagollib

The working parts of the Smeagol Wiki engine, stripped out as a library.

## Motivation

One of the significant problems with maintainin the Smeagol Wiki engine is that parts of the HTTP infrastructure on which it depends have changed in ways which it is not trivial to fix. Providing the guts of the engine as a library should make it easier to integrate with different HTTP infrastructure implementations, and also to integrate with other projects.

## Warning

Doesn't work yet.

## Notes

The caller should provide the equivalents of Luminus `handler.clj` and `middleware.clj`.
